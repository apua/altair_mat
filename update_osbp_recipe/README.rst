- Click on Windows should run and show the state.

              attr: ...
              desc: ...
              type: ...
              steps:
                  - name: ...
                    type: ...
                    para: ...
      script
          $name:
              desc: ...
              cont: ...
              type: ...
              sudo: ...
      config
          $name:
              desc: ...
              cont: ...

- Explain the requirements:
    + Python
    + Git

- Include Packages:
    + Requists
    + PyYAML

- Clean and import all OSBPs every time is expensive.

- Service temporarily unavailable error handling.

- Clean customized OSBPs could be force and fast.

  issues:

      #. using `api._list_index({'category': '...'})` is faster,
         but no `isCustomerContent` field,
         needs to know where is the end index of builtins

      #. delete methods are the same when using uri but id

- Export OSBP recipe can be more simple

- Let settings and customized OSBPs data as .txt file so that even notepad can open it.
